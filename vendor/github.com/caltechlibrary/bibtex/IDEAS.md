# Ideas for applying package

+ bibscrape - scrape plain text for common citation formats (maybe with hints) and render as BibTeX file.
    + Should have some sort of customizable feature to handle format similar too cases
+ biblint - a linter for BibTeX files
+ bibfmt - a tool that would limit Bib fields to specific lists and just format bib output consitently
+ bibfilter - a filter/cleaner for BibTeX files
+ bibjson2bib - convert BibJSON format to BibTeX format (use case results from JSON API transformed with *jq* to BibJson)
