# Installation

## Compiled version

*bibfilter* is a command line program run from a shell like Bash. If you download the 
repository a compiled version is in the dist directory. The compiled binary matching
your computer type and operating system can be copied to a bin directory in your PATH.

Compiled versions are available for Mac OS X (amd64 processor), Linux (amd64), Windows
(amd64) and Rapsberry Pi (both ARM6 and ARM7)

If you are using a Raspberry Pi 2 or later use the ARM7 binary, ARM6 is only for the first generaiton Raspberry Pi.

## Compiling from source

If you have go v1.6.2 or better installed then should be able to "go get" to install all the **bibtex** utilities and
package. You will need the GOBIN environment variable set. In this example I've set it to $HOME/bin.

```
    GOBIN=$HOME/bin
    go get github.com/caltechlibrary/bibtex/...
```

or

```
    git clone https://github.com/caltechlibrary/bibtex src/github.com/caltechlibrary/bibtex
    cd src/github.com/caltechlibrary/bibtex
    make
    make test
    make install
```
