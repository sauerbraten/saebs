[bibtex](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/bibtex) is a golang package for working with BibTeX files. 
It includes *bibfilter* and *bibmerge* which are a command line utilities for working with BibTeX files
(e.g. removing comments before importing into JabRef, merge bib lists).  *bibtex* also can be compiled to 
JavaScript via GopherJS. A web version of *bibfiter* and *bibmerge* commands is available in the 
[webapp](webapp/) directory. The command line utilities and webapp use
the same *bibtex* golang package for implementation.
